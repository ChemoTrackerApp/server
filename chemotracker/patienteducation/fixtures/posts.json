         "content": "When treating cancer, the goal may be to cure the cancer, lower the chance that cancer will return or slow the growth of tumours that cause pain or other problems. Chemotherapy may both extend life and/or increase your quality of life.\nWhat is it?\nChemotherapy (also known as chemo) is the name used for some types of anticancer medications. These medications are used to cure or control fast-growing cancer, to prepare a patient for other treatments like surgery or to ease cancer symptoms. \nAll chemotherapy medications are antineoplastic, meaning they slow cancer growth, or stop the growth of tumours (neoplasms). Some chemotherapy medications are cytotoxic, meaning they kill cells. Chemotherapy affects all fast-growing cells in the body, not just cancer cells. This is why there are many side effects associated with chemotherapy."

         "content": "Radiation involves using high-energy radiation beams in a very focused way to treat or cure cancer, or to provide relief from cancer symptoms. Approximately half of all cancer patients require radiation treatment at some point during the course of their illness. Radiation treatment is the use of a certain type of energy (radiation) from X-rays, gamma rays and electrons to destroy cancer cells. In high doses, radiation destroys cells in the area being treated. It does this by damaging the DNA (genetic information) in cancer cell genes, making it impossible for them to grow and divide. During radiation treatment, both cancer cells – which are growing in an uncontrolled way – and healthy cells are affected, but most healthy cells can repair themselves."

There are 2 main types of cervical cancer: Squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix, which starts in the cells that line the outside of the cervix. This is the most common type of cervical cancer. Adenocarcinoma of the cervix, which starts in the glandular cells that line the inside of the cervix. These cells make mucus and other fluids. The main cause of cervical cancer is the human papillomavirus (HPV), a common sexually transmitted virus. Learn more about HPV on the human papillomavirus page. There are several things you can do to lower your risk of cervical cancer: The more sexual partners you have, the greater your risk of being infected with HPV. Your risk may also be increased if a partner is a carrier of HPV or has had multiple sexual partners in the past. Most HPV infections occur in the first few years of sexual activity. There is some evidence that regular use of condoms or a diaphragm can help reduce the risk of cervical cancer by reducing exposure to HPV. The evidence is stronger for condoms than diaphragms. It’s important to know that even condoms can’t protect 100% against HPV or eliminate the risk of cervical cancer. The HPV vaccine (Gardasil®) is available at no charge to all Grade 7 girls and boys through Ontario’s publicly funded school-based program. In addition, the HPV vaccine is available on a user-pay basis. It is approved for women up to 45 years of age. If you are a woman, we encourage you to speak to your doctor about getting immunized. It is ideal to have the vaccination before you become sexually active and may be exposed to the HPV virus. However, even if you are already sexually active you may also benefit from the vaccine. The vaccine prevents most but not all cervical cancers. So all women – including those who have received the HPV vaccine – need to be screened regularly for cervical cancer. If a woman who is infected with a high-risk strain of HPV smokes, her risk of cervical cancer increases by up to 80%. Smoking inhibits the immune system, making it harder for the body to fight off infection. As well, smoking is linked to many types of cancer and other diseases. There is no safe kind of tobacco product and no safe amount of smoking. It’s never too late to benefit from becoming smoke-free. If you are already a non-smoker, keep yourself safe by avoiding exposure to other people’s tobacco smoke (second-hand smoke). For more information about quitting smoking, you can visit the Canadian Cancer Society. Pap tests check for cervical cell changes caused by HPV infection. Cervical cancer can sometimes be prevented by following these cell changes closely and treating them if necessary. Regular screening with Pap tests means there is a better chance of finding pre-cancerous cell changes so they can be treated and likely cured before cancer has a chance to develop. Be sure to go for regular Pap tests, and for follow-up testing if your Pap test result is abnormal. See the Screening section below to find out more, including who should get screened for cervical cancer."

Eating 100 grams of red meat (about the size of a deck of cards) or 50 grams of processed meat a day raises your risk of colorectal cancer by up to 20%. A high-fibre diet may help lower your risk of colorectal cancer. Fibre helps keep the colon healthy by speeding up the removal of stool (poop). You can get fibre from whole grains, vegetables and some fruit. Vegetables and fruit can also help: prevent nutritional deficiencies, provide you with natural sources of cancer-fighting vitamins, help you reach or stay at a healthy weight. If you’re not at a healthy weight, losing even a small amount of weight can help lower the risk to your health. Small changes in your diet and physical activity may be enough to help you become healthier. Being physically active can increase your health, well-being and quality of life, and reduce your risk of cancer. Being “active” doesn’t mean just formal exercise programs — lots of everyday activities, such as gardening, housework, dancing, or walking to work or the store, also count. Many are activities you can do with family or friends. There are risks you inherit from your family. The genes you are born with and whether or not your family members have had cancer both play a part in your risk of getting cancer. Genetic testing can tell if you have genetic changes (mutations) that increase your risk of certain cancers, like colorectal cancer. Although they are relatively rare, some genetic conditions are strongly related to colorectal cancer. They include: familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and attenuated FAP, MYH-associated polyposis (MAP), Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, Lynch syndrome, juvenile polyposis. Ontario’s colorectal cancer screening program, ColonCancerCheck, does not screen people who are at high risk of colorectal cancer because of genetic conditions. The program focuses on screening people at average or increased risk. Talk with your doctor or nurse practitioner to see if you would benefit from genetic assessment.
